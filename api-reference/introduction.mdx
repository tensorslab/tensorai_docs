## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the request header:

"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
  You can generate API keys from the [TensorAI Console](https://tensorai.tensorslab.com/).
</Note>

## Rate Limits

API usage is based on credits. Each model has different credit consumption rates:

| Model | Type | Credits per Generation |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| SeeDreamV4 | Image | 500 credits |
| SeeDreamV4.5 | Image | 800 credits |
| SeeDance | Video (5s) | 2000 credits |
*Note: The actual credit consumption displayed during generation shall prevail.*
